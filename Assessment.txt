This is the FedEx QA protractor assessment project.

Please refer to the folder: qa-test-assessment-master for the application code & the protractor tests.

Also in this folder:
- README.md for documentation on our little frontend app & how to get it running
- ASSESSMENT.MD: what we expect from you in the assessment
- ASSESSMENT_SOLUTION.MD will be your location to keep notes on your approach and document bugs you may find

Good luck and have fun!
